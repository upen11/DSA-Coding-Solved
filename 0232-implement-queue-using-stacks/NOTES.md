stack1 = push
pop() - command comes
stack2 if empty then push all stack1 elements in stack2.
now pop the top element.
push() -
now if push comes then put new element in the stack1. so we will have new elements in stack1.
Whenever we get pop statement we will take from stack2 because it is reversed.
So when it gets empty after all elements are popped out, we will again repeat the process of transfering all stack1 elements to stack2.
â€‹
when both stack1 and stack2 becomes empty that means our queue is also empty.
